# MQTT for Asynchronous Application
This project demonstrates an MQTT messaging application where a sender sends messages to a receiver using the Mosquitto MQTT broker.


## Files in the Repository

sender.py: A Python script that sends 1,000,000 messages to the MQTT broker and logs each message sent.

receiver.py: A Python script that receives messages from the MQTT broker, logs each message received, and prints the total count of messages received upon exiting.
